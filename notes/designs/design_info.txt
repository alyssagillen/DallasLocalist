The website is a single page
with a browser and responsive view.

The home page features 
    a graphic for the title/logo,
    a collection of events,
    contact information

The design is built out of custom components
The information for the events will be populated from a .json file
    (This makes it easy to add and remove events. The website manager
    adds or removes the event information into the .json file without
    any dependency on a developer.)
